# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-USING-K-MEANS
## Data Science & Analytics Internship Project – Tamizhan Skills

## Introduction
This project, Customer Segmentation Using K-Means, is developed as part of the Data Science and Analytics Internship at Tamizhan Skills. Customer segmentation plays a vital role in modern business strategies by enabling organizations to understand customer behavior and design personalized marketing campaigns. Instead of treating all customers the same, businesses can group customers based on shared characteristics and purchasing patterns.

This project applies unsupervised machine learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on demographic and behavioral features.

## Problem Statement
Businesses often struggle to effectively target customers due to diverse purchasing behaviors and preferences. Without customer segmentation, marketing campaigns become inefficient and less impactful.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Segment customers into meaningful groups
- Analyze customer behavior using unsupervised learning
- Apply K-Means clustering to identify customer types
- Visualize clusters using 2D and 3D scatter plots
- Support targeted marketing and personalized offers

This project aligns with Tamizhan Skills internship objectives by strengthening practical knowledge of clustering algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (customer_segmentation_data.csv) contains customer demographic and behavioral attributes such as:

- Age
- Spending Score
- Membership Years
- Purchase Frequency
- Last Purchase Amount
  
These features help identify customer engagement and spending behavior.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas – Data handling and analysis
- Scikit-learn – Scaling and clustering algorithms
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
- K-Means Clustering Algorithm

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data science workflow implemented in the program code:

1. Loading customer data using Pandas

2. Selecting numerical features relevant for clustering

3. Applying StandardScaler to normalize data

4. Determining optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method

5. Applying K-Means clustering with selected cluster count

6. Assigning cluster labels to each customer

7. Visualizing customer segments using 2D scatter plots

8. Visualizing customer segments using 3D scatter plots

9. Analyzing cluster characteristics using group-wise averages

These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and separation of customer segments.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation in a real-world business scenario. Through the Tamizhan Skills Data Science and Analytics Internship, valuable experience was gained in unsupervised learning, feature scaling, cluster evaluation, and data visualization. The insights generated from this project can help businesses improve customer engagement, retention, and marketing effectiveness.
